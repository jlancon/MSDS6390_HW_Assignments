Assignment 2:  Self Portrait

Using Processing's 2D drawing functions, create a self-portrait. Structure your code 
so that changing a size or position variable updates the entire portrait. Please be prepared 
to discuss how the algorithmic/coding process impacted the finished piece as compared to drawing,
painting, or photographing a self-portrait.
